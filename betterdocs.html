            We strongly suggest that you do not use BetterDocs in the future as it hosts many broken and sometimes dangerous plugins, as well as self-bots which are strongly discouraged by the BetterDiscord developement team.
            In the future, we suggest you use the <a href="https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbOR8bKrMJ">#theme-repo</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbORBSfCjI">#plugin-repo</a> channels on the BetterDiscord server.
